# recipes

Hi! This is my nth (I forgot how many times) attempt in learning web development through The Odin Project. For this recipies project page, this is how I envision the finished product will be:

- It will be a website where people can share recipes. People can register, login, upload recipes of their choice. Other users can browse through entering a search query or using the navigation bars. Other users can comment and give rating to the recipes. Anonymouse (not logged in) users can view but cannot comment and rate. 

The planned pages/features for the website:
- Homepage
    - Random recipes
    - Content TBD
- Login/Logout
- Register
- [logged in users only] Post a recipe
    - Title
    - Images
    - Ingredients
    - Directions
    - Nutritional facts
- Recipe page
    - [logged in users only] Post a comment
    - [logged in users only] Post a rating
- Changelogs (for dev purposes only, I want to login the work done)
- More features TBD

Will update the website as I go through the programming lessons. For now, here's a newbie template for an initial commit!
